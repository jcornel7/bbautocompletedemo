Countries Autocomplete
======================

### About

A project I built for a technical interview. The assignment was to build an autocomplete search input that will display country flags, given only a csv file of the flags. I was allowed to use jQuery but no other libraries could be used. 

### Installation

To run this project first  ```npm install``` and then ```npm start``` to start the server. Then navigate to localhost:3000 in Chrome. This project uses new features of ES6 so it won't work in other browsers without a build step to transpile to ES5.

### Usage

Start typing in the input and view search results. Click on countries you want to add.
